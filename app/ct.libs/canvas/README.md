This module allows you to create virtual canvases, draw ct.js graphic on them, and then reuse these canvases by drawing them on a main canvas. You can also append them to a game's page.

Use cases include:

* procedurally generating a tiled level and then drawing it as is, for improved performance;
* drawing decals, stains and other permanent effects to the background;
* caching complex vector shapes;
* creating additional viewports for artistic purposes.
