This is a legacy version of `ct.mouse` that does not support Actions.

`ct.mouse` handles mouse movement and press events.

There are three states in mouse events:

- `pressed` – a mouse button was just pushed down. Along with that, a `down` event is called;
- `down` – a mouse button is still being held;
- `released` – a mouse button was released.
